Tag Rocket was made for a CompeC (Boğaziçi University IT Club) gaming event called Tag Night. People played the game and tried to get the highscore for a prize. The game is a simple infinite scroller where you are trying to avoid obstacles.
It was both on AppStore and Google Play when it was released but right now it is only available on Google Play.

This game was made in a week. Currently the project is on hiatus but source code is up on GitHub and we might continue and polish it to be a full game one day.

Programming was made by me and [Mahmut Karaca](http://www.karacasoft.com/) using Unity3D. He also handled releasing it on mobile.
Our friend Bartu did the artwork as placeholders. We decided to keep the placeholders since they were good enough. [A link to his twitter.](https://twitter.com/ZipperQR)
