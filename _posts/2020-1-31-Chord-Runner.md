I made a simple project about music and hand movements. Project report, source code and execution details are in [the project repository](https://github.com/bcetin/chord-runner).
As a result I will just talk a little bit about my personal experience with the project in this short post. But first here is the demo video of it:

I had the chance to play with a [Reactable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactable) at [Copernicus Science Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus_Science_Centre) while visiting Warsaw.
Great place by the way. If you have any interest in popular science and end up in Warsaw it is worth visiting.

At the same time I had to come up with a project for my Cognitive Systems course. The only constraint about the project was having some relation to human cognition.
After having some experience with a really fun musical device like the Reactable, I wanted to try something similar. I also took this as an opportunity to use my music theory knowledge from a course I took back in Turkey.
As a result I wanted to do something with a Leap Motion device and my professor was kind enough to provide me one for the semester.

First steps of the project was really frustrating because I could not get it to work on Windows. Then I tried setting it up in a Linux virtual machine.
After a lot of effort the device was working but because of the USB bandwith limitations of the virtual machine it was not working properly. Then I went and downloaded Ubuntu. After that I realized I already had an Ubuntu OS in my computer for a project I was part of last year. Then I spent a few more hours to compile and build everything from scratch again. Finally it worked.

I did a several prototypes for things I did not include in the final project. I also tried doing something using granular synthesis but that proved to be complicated for a new Pure Data user like me. I can say I learned a lot and it felt good to do something coherent after a long period of time without any proper programming projects.

I am also aware that I am not using this blog properly. But hopefully in the next months I will have more time and stuff to write about here. See you on the next post!
