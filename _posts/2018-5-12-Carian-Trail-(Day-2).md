title: Carian Trail (Day 2)

[Previous](/Carian-Trail-(Day-1)/) &#124; [Next](Carian-Trail-(Day-3)/)

I woke up around 9AM and ate some of the snacks I brought with me from Istanbul. Packing up the tent took some time since I was tired from the last day. And a minute after I started walking I ended up in a place where I could see 5 different walkable trails and no waymarks.
Even with the help of GPS it took some time for me to find the correct path. This part of the trail had really great views all over. I took a few pictures.

A fun moment was the part where I had to literally crawl. Branches of the plants were low and very thick so that was the only option. Not after very long the forest part ended and an open field welcomed me.

This area is usually covered with olive trees. As I kept walking between the trees I saw a family having breakfast and said hi. They invited me to join. Considering the fact that I was low on water, the water they provided was really valuable, and having a breakfast for free in the middle of nowhere was a bonus.
They said they live in Bodrum and owned some of the trees in the field. We kept chatting about my journey, the trail, airport etc. while having breakfast.
After this nice break I started walking again. But not before taking a picture.

Also a picture of a dog and her puppy from the same place.

This part of the trail is walking under the sun for an hour which was really tiring. I took a break at the shadow of ruins I stumbled upon.

Also let me talk about the problems I had with clothing. I did not expect the weather to be this hot and did not bring any short sleeved tees. Same goes for the pants too. This fact really amplified the tiredness. So I was really happy when I reached to a fountain where I can wash my face and cool down in general.

The fountain is a part of a ruins which includes a lot of separate buildings including the Beçin Castle. Here are some pictures I took while seeing around.

Though excavation is still in development, the site is worth seeing for the view from the castle. From there the trail is kind of interrupted with the city. Milas is a fairly developed town and you have to pass through it as a part of the trail. I just hitchhiked to a mall where I can buy a t-shirt and a hat. I also charged my phone and ate at a Burger King. I agree that this stop makes the journey a non-trail thing since a mall is civilization at its peak compared to camping. But I had to solve the clothing problem.
After that I walked to the road of the next village. But before that I bought some extra snacks and a meal from BIM, which is a really cheap market chain in Turkey and I highly recommend it if you want to stay in a budget. Next village is Kırcağız and the road to there is just concrete. I recommend you to skip this part if you can. I just hitchhiked again.
The village itself can be worth walking since there are ruins of old buildings etc.

After walking a bit more you reach to another sign of the trail.

A path that made me think if following all red signs I see is a good idea or not.

From this point on son started to go down and entire reason for walking was finding a place to camp. Sadly, most of the ground was covered with long grass-ish plants. More sadly, most of the grass was covered with spider webs. So I kept walking, hoping that I would find a better place without spiders.
But there wasn't any. Then I decided a rock formation was flat enough to place a tent on. And thinking that there wouldn't be much wind I just placed the tent over the rock without pegs. I was really tired already after a day of walking. I just laid down after eating. Though I had hard time sleeping this night again. Not because of fear but because of more practical problems. Like heat and then wind. Outer layer of the tent started flapping with the wind with night. This was a bit of a shock at first since it really felt like something was out of the tent. So I learned another tip for myself, even if you are on a rock, tie at least the outer layer to somewhere. After fixing these problems I managed to sleep.

It took much longer than I expected to write down this post. And I can't say anything about the third part since it is finals time. As a side note, I managed to setup an environment where I can build my site on my own computer. So it will be much easier for me to write down these posts from now on. So, see you on the next post at some point I guess.
