title: Carian Trail (Day 3)

[Previous](/Carian-Trail-(Day-2)/)

I woke up around 8 AM because of the heat. Sun was above so even though it was cool outside it was very hot in the tent. I wanted to enjoy my Barbunya Pilaki outside watching the view but bugs did not leave me alone so I had to have my breakfast inside the tent.

After packing up I started walking again. After some walk on a similar landscape, the path became very narrow and steep next to a house. Then I climbed up to a road. I hoped to see some people around there to ask for water but I was out of luck. I also drank the last bit of my water at that point, sadly.

Another trail sign was up there.

An abandoned house I stumbled upon.

After some time the dirt road connected to an actual asphalt road and kept going on like that for a bit. Then it turned into a forest again. I think there is a fountain on this part of the road but for some reason, I walked off the path a bit and missed it. I was not lost since I had my GPS with me but from that first detour, I was not able to return to the designated path for some time because of the landscape.
Though it was sad not being on the correct path with no water, the detour I took led me to a great rocky area which provided a great 360-degree view of the nature around me. I climbed up a boulder and rested there about an hour. This was the best part of my journey.

Being already thirsty I wanted to get back on the track afterwards. But there was a problem. The actual road that the trail follows was completely fenced with spiky twigs all the way and the side I was on was not easy to walk. So I decided to somehow jump over the fence. First, I threw my entire bag over. Then, I carefully tried to step on rocks in order to not get scratches. Afterwards, I loaded my bag again and kept walking. I just wanted to reach to Labranda at this point. Because of the problems I mentioned my bag was heavier than it should be and I felt like returning home. I had other stuff to do in the holiday too.
So I decided to stop at Labranda and hitchhike to city. With these in my mind I ate my last apple for some extra moisture. All I have about this part of the walk is some pictures.

A turtle!!!!





A narrow path leads you to [Labranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labraunda) archeological site. I walked in through the gate with the hopes of finding water. And there was a tap. There was nobody around the site at first. Then I learned that a guard lives near there.

A tired me.

A picture from the site. I walked around but did not actually see all of it. So, I cannot actually comment on how good the place was at that moment.

And it was over. I hitchhiked to 4 vehicles in total to get to Aydın bus terminal. Then took a bus to İzmir, to home. This journey was mostly experimental for me. I learned a lot and will do similar trails in the future. Now I am leaving you with a picture from [Karpuzlu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpuzlu), which was the original endpoint of this 7 day segment of the trail. I passed by there in a car.

Hopefully I will be back for another one. From Karpuzlu to Labranda this time, to complete the trail.
