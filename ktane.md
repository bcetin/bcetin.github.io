Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a cooperative game on Steam which I really like.
After they released their modding tools with Unity I started developing some modules for the game and released them on Steam Workshop.
Learned a lot about Unity along the way. I am still maintaining all of these mods up to date with the game. Source codes are available on GitHub.

### Connection Check

*Release: 15 Aug, 2016*

Connection Check was the very first module I developed for KTaNE.
My initial idea was to do something about a given graph structure.
Then decided to make it about checking if a connection exists between nodes in a graph.
This is one of the most known modded modules among community since it's beginner friendly and was released at a really early stage of modding support.

### Monsplode Modules

#### Monsplode, Fight! & Who's that Monsplode?

*Release: 8 Oct, 2016*

Started with this idea a few months after Connection Check.
I was playing Pokemon Uranium and while looking at the type chart I thought this can make a nice module. And it can be doubled up with a needy based on the "Who is that Pokemon?" scene of the TV show.
So I started asking my artist friends if any of them were interested in the subject. One of them agreed to work with me on this project. ([She goes by the name Reikasura](https://kawaiinegi.deviantart.com/)) 
Then for a long time we just designed fake Pokemons with cool names and she drew them. Then I coded the module itself. Though it had several iterations since it's release, most of the community grew to love Monsplodes. After the initial community reaction I decided to have a raffle where 2 random people would have their monsplode design in game.




#### Monsplode Trading Cards

*Release: 10 Sep, 2017*

This one was added to Monsplode Modules after a year from its release. The initial idea came from @Grybo from KTaNE discord channel. I loved it from the beginning but it took a few months for me to able to actually work on the project. We did some playtesting then back and forth but finally it was released.
This one is really complicated and hard compared to most of modded modules out there. And it has a nice design as far as I think. Cards look like actual trading cards. Flavor texts are there. There are a special versions of some initial Monsplodes.
