Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a cooperative game on Steam which I really liked.
After they released their modding tools with Unity I started developing some module ideas.
Learned a lot about Unity along the way.

### Connection Check

Connection Check was my very first module idea for KTaNE.
My initial idea was to do something about a given graph structure.
Then decided to make it about checking if a connection exists between nodes in a graph.
This is one of the most known modded modules among community since it's beginner friendly and was released at a really early stage of modding support.
