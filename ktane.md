Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a cooperative game on Steam which I really like.
After they released their modding tools with Unity I started developing some modules for the game and released them on Steam Workshop.
Learned a lot about Unity along the way. I am still maintaining all of these mods up to date with the game. Source codes are available on GitHub.

*Release: 15 Aug, 2016*

Connection Check was the very first module I developed for KTaNE.
My initial idea was to do something about a given graph structure.
Then decided to make it about checking if a connection exists between nodes in a graph.
This is one of the most known modded modules among community since it's beginner friendly and was released at a really early stage of modding support.

### Monsplode Modules

Started with this idea few months after Connection Check.
I was playing Pokemon Uranium and while looking at the type chart I thought this can make a nice module.
So I started asking my artist friends if any of them were interested in the subject.
